Stock Ticker App

This application was originally designed to call the Yahoo Finance API to retrieve stock quotes for the user.  That service no longer
exists so this application was modified to only provide ficticious stock quotes from a SQL database.  A simple web UI was added
onto this program after completion but was not the main focus of the project.
